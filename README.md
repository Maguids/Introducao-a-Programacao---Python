# Introduction to Programming -> Python

---

This repository aims to expose **my resolutions of the exercises proposed by the subject 'Introduction to Programming'**, as well as **its statements**.
These exercises were made available to me through Mooshak, and were divided into 4 sets.
In each folder are available the statements and my respective resolutions that were accepted by Mooshak.
